Project Description
This module explores techniques for discovering interesting relationships and patterns in large datasets through association rule mining and applying these insights to build recommendation systems.

Key Learning Outcomes:

Analyze transactional data and extract frequent itemsets using algorithms like Apriori and FP-Growth.

Evaluate association rules using metrics such as support, confidence, and lift.

Study recommendation system fundamentals, including association-based recommenders, collaborative filtering, and hybrid approaches for improved accuracy.

By the end of this module, you will be able to mine meaningful associations from data and design effective recommendation engines widely used in e-commerce, marketing, and user personalization
